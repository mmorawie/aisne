Simple FDTD implementation


Some results of this program are available at https://fdtdproject.wordpress.com


The algorithm itself can be found in the src/Fdtd.h and src/Fdtd3d.h files.
As implemented now, the the simulation has the following parameters:

time step = 0.1 fs

cell size = 0.1 um



A full build requires Qt 4.0 and Freetype libraries.
